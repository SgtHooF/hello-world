I've decided to make a roguelike on the GameBoy.
I dont know why i have, it's 2015.

The code was all downloaded off the web, probably most of it from websites like github.
My quest was to find a compile-able set of files where i would write "printf("Hello World");".
And I found them.

Download the whole lot and go to "gbdk\examples\gb\dscan".
In there is a file called "dscan.c", and thats where Main() is.

I've commented it faily well, but i havent mucked about with the other files.

The "make.bat" is set to make a .gb file called "OPENME.gb" and then try to open it.
So run that.
On my machines .gb files are all set to automaticly open with visual boy advance, so try that, its pretty rad.
Not to mention that it makes this whole process a bit quicker.

Notepad++ is also bretty gud for this, it's syntax hightlight is ok.

Please try and ignore any rude words you may see in any comments or variables.
